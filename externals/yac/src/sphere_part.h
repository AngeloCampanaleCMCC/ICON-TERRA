/**
 * \page sphere_part_docu Sphere Partitioning Algorithm
 *
 * The following describes how the Sphere Partitioning algorithm generates a
 * tree data structure for a given set of polygons on a sphere.
 * This tree structure allows to easily search all cells in the given data
 * set that overlaps with another given cell or point (set of cells or points).
 *
 * \section sphere_part_tree_gen Generation of tree structure
 * to partition a set of polygons on the sphere the following data structure can be constructed:
 * - c = center of sphere
 * - S = set of all points
 *
 * \subsection recurspart_sec Description for a routine that generates the tree
 * recurspart(P, v, t)
 * -# Set p to balance point of P
 * -# Compute great circle L with base plane collinear to |c p| and orthogonal to v
 * -# Partition data
 *    -# Set I to subset of S intersecting L
 *    -# Set T to subset of S/I with positive scalar product to normal vector of L
 *       - Ti = recurspart(T, norm(L)) if |T| > threshold t else Ti = list(T)
 *    -# Set U to subset of S/I with negative scalar product to normal vector of L
 *       - Ui = recurspart(U, norm(L)) if |U| > threshold t else Ui = list(U)
 * -# return node(list(I), Ti, Ui, L, alpha=angle over L containing I)
 *
 * \subsection recuspart_observ_sec Observations
 * - I, T, U and form a partition of S
 * - first L is orthogonal to equator, i.e. a longitude circle
 * - initial call: recurspart(S, (0,0,1), t)
 *
 * \section sphere_part_search Searching in the tree structure
 *
 * \subsection search_sec Description for a routine that searches for a list of cells
 * search(n, p)
 * -# if n is leaf
 *    -# P = search_list(n, p)
 * -# else
 *    -# P = {}
 *    -# if p in n.alpha
 *       - P = P united search_list(n.I, p)
 *    -# if p * norm(n.L) > 0
 *       - P = P united search(n.Ti, p)
 *    -# else if p * norm(n.L) < 0
 *       - P = P united search(n.Ui, p)
 * -# return P
 *
 * \subsection search_observ_sec Observations
 * - returns list of matching polygons
